# About the construction

The xlsx file is stored as exploded in `xlsx_deconstructed`. This is a choice to make version control more efficient (tracking a binary does _not_ feel efficient). Modifications are made in the compiled xlsx file, in Excel.

Scripts to construct/deconstruct the Excel file will be provided later.
